## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è
### Backend
- **Python FastAPI**: Framework for handling multiple user requests efficiently and manage multiple websocket connections on server side.
- **Websocket**: To handle Real Time messaging between users with robust server-client synchronization.

### Frontend
- **React Native or Expo Dev**: Frameworks for developing android, ios or web application
- **EAS Cli**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery for creating production-ready application.

### Services
- **AI Integration**: Integrated TogetherAI's meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free model for AI assisted chat recommendation, ensuring conversational relevance and coherence.
- **Git/GitHub**: Utilized for version control, enabling efficient tracking of code changes, and supporting Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD).
- **Giphy API service**: Utilized the Giphy API to retrieve public GIF URLs based on user input. This integration enhances user engagement by enabling users to search for specific GIFs, stickers, or emojis and share them seamlessly with their friends through API integration
- **Azure Web Service**: Hosted backend using Azure's Free SKU instance for CI/CD and public accessibility. Only allows 5 concurrent websocket connection at a time due to limited resource usage.
- **PostgreSQL Service (via Vercel)**: For maintaining data integrity and securely stores user-related data, including credentials and messages.

Below diagram shows how WebSocket server manages real-time, bidirectional communication between connected users, ensuring seamless message delivery via specific WebSocket URLs.

## Key Responsibilities and Achievements

### Design and Development
- Designed both architecture of the application, ensuring real time messaging and AI integration.
- Developed the front-end using frameworks like react native, expo dev, creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface
- Used FastAPI Framework and websocket to handle realtime messaging.
- Managed and optimized the backend processes to handle real-time user interactions efficiently.
- Implemented chat memory management feature for AI to read users conversations style or identify persona using their past conversations. 
- Ensured smooth communication between the UI and the AI models, reducing latency and improving performance.

### Memory Retention
 Chat conversations are managed both on server side using psql database and on client side using redux persists.

## Impact
- Improved UI/UX design, making the application user-friendly.



## Installation and Setup Instruction üñ•Ô∏è
- ### Clone the Repository 
If you have a repository for your project, clone it using git: 
```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Akshat2512/Chatwave.git 
     cd Chatwave # move to the root folder of the application
```
Next, create a separate virtual environment for python dependencies
```bash
     python -m venv my_env &&
     my_env/Script/activate
```
Then install required libraries
```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then for starting application, first start the fastapi server i.e., app.py, run directly using this script in the terminal:
```bash
    uvicorn app:app --host localhost --port 5000 --reload
```

this, endpoint will accept all app requests Go to https://localhost:5000.
